But…

Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition 3 uses retail MSDN keys, this is misleading as it combines them with certs in the UI, making it look like an OEM key.
When the keys reach their maximum activation limit or Microsoft blocks them, this will become useless, unless Napalum has an unlimited supply of MSDN keys.

Back up your tokens.dat file if you must have a version other than Ultimate.


FAQ:
 
Q: I the novice user of the PC, saw that there are various activators Windows 7 Loader. What of them to select? 
A: To beginners and those who not ready to restore the loader, owing to impossibility to boot after application of activators, it is recommended to use only safe Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3. If the "Loader" method used then press "Cancel" button after reboot.
 
Q: How to use the activator? 
A: Start w7lxe.exe, do nothing, wait when all makes the activator in an automatic mode. 

Q: Online genuine validation shows the error.
A: KB971033 is blocked for the purpose of preventing possible activation loss in the future.

Q: Can't Microsoft begin to ban modified BIOS with SLIC 2.1?
A: Yes, it is theoretically possible. In Windows Vista times loaders banning was just theory too.

Q: What emulation mode is used by default?
A: Safest emulation is used for SLIC emulator check. If SLIC emulation and activation has passed successfully than UnSafe emulation.
 
Q: For me it was not initial the load menu and  delay time for boot menu but why after  application of the "Loader" method there is 30 second return counting? 
A: Such occurs only at the first reboot what in case if the SLIC emulator does not work (black screen) it was possible to reboot and use the native choice Windows 7. Other activators, in the case if the SLIC emulator does not work, it demands to restore procedure with installation DVD usage.

Q: I do not wish to use illegal keys and KMS servers, but thus I wish to have to have "genuine software" status. What can recommend? 
A: Use the grace period. For limitation overcoming on the maximum period of usage (4x30=120 days) to apply the "Trial Reset" method to reset of counters: 
w7lxe.exe->Trial Reset->Activate
or 
w7lxe.exe /method=TrialReset

Q: How to restore system after unsuccessful usage of TrialReset method by 3.115-3.118 version? 
A: Run
w7lxe.exe /trial-recovery
from different windows 7 or Windows Vista installation.
 
Q: I wish to make on Windows 7 and Windows Vista 49516 grace days the "49516 Trial Days" method as a constant working solution of a question about activation. 
A: It is not necessary to make such choice as a constant basis. With the advent of the "Trial Reset" method the such solution has lost sense. Though for Windows Server 2008R2/2008 it is quite applicable. The "49516 Trial Days" method now has more likely fact-finding character that such is possible. 
 
Q: After application of the "Loader" method activation does not occur. What to do? 
A:
1) Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Install
2) Reboot 
3) Advanced Mode->Upload Screenshot
Or keyboard->PrintScreen; Run->MsPaint->Paste->Save; http://imageshack.us/->Browse...->start upload
4) Ask advanced users for help, having placed a screenshot. 
 
Q: Used the "Loader" method, after rebooting the activator choice (Windows 7 Loader XE) does not load Windows. It was necessary to take advantage of the original choice. 
A: It most likely means that the SLIC emulator used by default does not work on the given computer. 
Try other emulators (it is necessary to reboot each time): 
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: MBR SLIC Loader->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: Vista Boot 08.0501->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: Vista Loader 2.1.2->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: WOW7 Loader->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: W7 Loader (Default)->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: W7 Loader (Alternative)->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: W7 Loader (LowMemory)->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: SLIC Driver->Install
 
Q: How to change delay time for boot menu? 
A: Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->timeouts
 
Q: In what advantage Safest emulation? 
A: Always there is a possibility after rebooting to load Windows that is important when the SLIC emulator does not work. Safe emulation should gives the such possibility too.

Q: At start the activator shows the message that it supports only FAT and NTFS file systems. 
A: It is possible to skip compulsorily the check of the file system and to start the activator: 
w7lxe.exe/fscheck=off
Or for preventing from undesirable effects: 
w7lxe.exe/fscheck=off/bootsect=off /mbr=off
- In these two variants UnSafe emulation does not work. 
 
Q: In the list of warnings it is written: "Loader: SCSI boot device detected!". What consequences can occur owing to application of the "Loader" method? 
A: Warnings specify in the reason there can not pass activation. In this case SLIC emulation will probably not work.
If the emulator has not worked, in such situation it is necessary to try: 
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: Vista Boot 08.0501->Install
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: SLIC Driver->Install

Q: In the list of warnings it is written: "Incomplite SLIC(OEMX) detected!".
A: It is necessary to try:
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader: MBR SLIC Loader->Install
 
Q: How the automatic mode of the activator works? How it makes a choice of a method for the recommendation? 
A: If for the installed edition Windows exists OEM:SLP key and SLIC is detected - the "Certificate" method is recommended.
If SLIC is absent - the "Loader" method.
If for the installed edition of Windows does not exist OEM:SLP key - the "180+ Days" method.
Thus all line of editions Windows 7/Vista/2008R2/2008 becomes covered (Except N and E editions which can be activated by self-decision). if Windows marked as "Pirated" Or other methods are not applicable - than "Trial Reset" method.

A:
1) Advanced Mode->Key AND Certificates->Key: OEM:SLP (OEM) Key->Install
2) Advanced Mode->Key AND Certificates->Certificate->Install

2) Advanced Mode->KMS Activation->Activate
 
Q: What sequence of operations corresponds to the "Certificate" method in the automatic mode? 
A:
1) Advanced Mode->Key AND Certificates->Key: OEM:SLP (OEM) Key->Install

A: Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Emulation: Safe->Install
Or 
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Emulation: UnSafe->Install
- the such solution is preferable.

Q: It is necessary to customize loading Windows through bcdedit, in particular bcdedit-set testsigning on and HASP driver does not work.
A: Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Emulation: Safe->Install
Or 
Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Emulation: UnSafe->Install
 
Q: At loading computer there is a flashing menu. How to remove the flashing or the menu? 
A: Advanced Mode->Boot Loader->Emulation: UnSafe->Install
 
Q: I wish to activate at once through UnSafe emulation.  Whether it is necessary so to do? 
A: No, it is recommended to pick up in the beginning the working SLIC emulator, with which Windows is activated. 
After that it is possible to install through UnSafe SLIC emulation, with the big share of probability, it will work without complications. 

Q: I use... (Something like a virtual file system) for disk image creation in real time. It boots before Windows - I am afraid to use the "Loader" method. 
A: In an automatic mode (Safest emulation) usually the boot sector and the boot loader are not rewritten.
What to prevent those exclusive situations in which the activator all the same rewrites boot sector, it is possible to use the command line key: 
w7lxe.exe/bootsect=off /mbr=off
 
Q: What physical changes bring in system for UnSafe, Safe and Safest  emulation modes? 
A:
Safest - changes mention only the boot menu. 
Safe - changes mention only the boot loader. 
UnSafe - changes mention boot sector and the loader. 
 
Q: What changes bring in process of loading Windows for UnSafe, Safe and Safest  emulation modes? 
A:
Safest - the activator loader calls Windows.
Safe - the activator loader calls the original boot loader.
UnSafe - the boot sector calls the activator loader, the activator loader calls the original boot loader.
 
Q: In what emulation mode (UnSafe, Safe, Safest) other activators Windows 7 Loader work? 
A: UnSafe
 
Q: I have a legal MSDN key for edition distinct from that which is installed, Windows refuses to accept it. 
A: Advanced Mode->Key AND Certificates->Key: Retail (MSDN) Key->Install
 
Q: How the activator allows installing keys of editions distinct from that which has been installed? 
A: Such it is possible thanks to existence of the internal mechanism Windows "Anytime Upgrade". Direct interaction of the activator with it allows not breaking functioning of the activation mechanism  (in difference of other "universal" activators).
 
Q: How to get the information about the new key? 
A: Advanced Mode->Key AND Certificate->Key->Get Info
 
Q: Where to learn what keys of the command line and external files support the activator? 
A: Advanced Mode->Windows 7 Loader XE->Info
 
Q: Where to learn the detailed information about Safest, Safe, Unsafe emulation? 
A: The scheme in archive: Info\w7lxe-emu1-3500.png
