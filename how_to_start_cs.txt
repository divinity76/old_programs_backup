start hl.exe with parameters
hl.exe -game cstrike

how to add bots:
enter console (tab) and write
bot_add : add a bot to team with least players

bot_add_ct : add bot to counter strike team
bot_add_t : add bot to terrorist team

serial: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

if you get the error "Counter Strike Available Memory Less Than 15MB" error during startup,
 set "Compatibility mode: Windows XP SP2" (i get this on Intel Integrated, but not nVidia GPUs..)
