Notes:
- guilds and houses are saved during server save, not when player logouts,
- if you want to place boss use /m, because /summon makes him your summon (no loot),
- items 1740,1747,1748,1749,1770 are for quests and cannot be moved nor picked (attribute questbox="1" in items.xml),
- ip ban lasts until server restart, character ban lasts until you set banned to 0 in player's file,
- when you switch ring from ground with ring on you the one from you still glimmers on the ground (no side effect),
- when you change light item (torch, candle, etc.) you lose effect of light spell,
- plague-, magic-, flame- and poisonthrowers are causing debugs (don't use them).


Known bugs:
- when you jump into player while beeing /invisible he gets debug,
- when you change world type from pvp to no-pvp players that have selected target earlier can still attack (until they lose target),
- some edges dissappear under blood splashes.
