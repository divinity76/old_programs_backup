]

[ COMPILING
	Linux
		Download required packages
			Debian \ Ubuntu
				Launch a terminal, and paste in this command:
					sudo apt-get install subversion autoconf automake make g++ libxml2 libxml2-dev libxml++2.6-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0 liblua5.1-0-dev libboost-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-thread-dev libmysql++-dev libgmp3-dev liblua5.1-sql-mysql2 liblua5.1-sql-sqlite2 liblua5.1-sql-mysql-dev liblua5.1-sql-sqlite-dev libsqlite3-dev
					wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/asio/boost_asio_1_4_7.tar.gz
					tar -xf boost_asio_1_4_7.tar.gz
					sudo cp -ar boost_asio_1_4_7/boost/* /usr/include/boost/
					sudo g++ boost_asio_1_4_7/libs/system/src/error_code.cpp -c -o /usr/lib/libboost_system.a

			sudo: command not found
				If you're running Debian it's possible that you don't
				have sudo, if that's the case then you can run 'su' and
				you will have root access. Then execute the commands
				without 'sudo' in the beginning.

		Download sourcecode
			Launch a terminal, and paste in this command:
				svn co svn://svn.otland.net/public/forgottenserver/tags/0.2.11pl2

		Compiling
			Launch a terminal, and type this command:
				cd 0.2.11pl2/ && make

		Linker eror
			If you receive a linker error saying something with 'libboost',
			try pasting the following commands to terminal and then move back
			to compiling again:
				ln /usr/lib/libboost_regex-mt.so /usr/lib/libboost_regex.so && ln /usr/lib/libboost_regex-mt.a /usr/lib/libboost_regex.a && ln /usr/lib/libboost_thread-mt.so /usr/lib/libboost_thread.so && ln /usr/lib/libboost_thread-mt.a /usr/lib/libboost_thread.a

	Windows
		MinGW
			Download latest MinGW and follow the compiling tutorial \
			that will be soon made by Talaturen or Fallen \
			then open up a new command line and type this:
			cd /path/to/sources
			NOTE: replace "/path/to/sources" with the actuall path.
			for example if you are building with latest mingw do:
			mingw32-make WIN32=1 LATEST_MINGW=1
			If you want sqlite instead of mysql do this:
			mingw32-make WIN32=1 LATEST_MINGW=1 SQLITE=1
			If you are compiling with an older version of mingw then \
			just remove LATEST_MINGW=1.
			NOTE: WIN32 is used for windows so don't remove it while \
			compiling.
			NOTE: that this will compile the GUI one, if you don't \
			want GUI just remove -mwindows and add -D__CONSOLE__ in CXXFLAGS

		Dev-Cpp
			Download The Forgotten Dev-Cpp and the sources from:
				http://otland.net/showthread.php?t=1024

			Extract them anywhere and then run devcpp.exe, press on the
			menuitem "File -> Open Project or File" and choose:
				C:\path\to\source_code\dev-cpp\TheForgottenServer.dev.

			At this point Dev-Cpp should be running with the project,
			now you can hit:
				"Execute -> Rebuild All".

			After it get compiled, copy TheForgottenServer.exe from:
				C:\path\to\sources\dev-cpp to directory above (C:\path\to\source_code)
